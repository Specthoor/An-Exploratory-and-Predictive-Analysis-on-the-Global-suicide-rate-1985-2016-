# An-Exploratory-and-Predictive-Analysis-on-the-Global-suicide-rate-1985-2016-

The project seeks to study the global suicide rate among
various countries. This project analyzes the dataset that
covers the numbers of suicide cases happening in different
countries from the 80s. In the first part of this project, I will
try to see if there are patterns involved in suicide rates among
countries, gender, age group etc. For the purpose of this
study, some research questions have been proposed and with
the help of our exploratory data analysis, conclusions would
be made based off the visualization of the trends/patterns in
our data.
Some of the proposed research questions that will be
answered during data preprocessing are.
• Which countries have the highest and least suicide
rates and suicide counts.
• Is suicide rate depreciating or increasing over the
years?
• Are there signs that certain age groups are inclined
towards suicide?
• Is gender an important factor?
• What variables correlate to suicide rate? (Variable
importance).
Also, during the exploratory data analysis, I will be picking
a country of interest (United states) to analyze the specific
rates in this country. Some questions would be answered
during this analysis, such as,
• How does the number of suicides vary over time
in the United States?
• In the United states, do adults also have higher
suicide rates?
• Which gender is more inclined towards suicide in
the US?
• Which generation has the highest suicide number
in the US?
The second part of this project involves building several
regression models that will be trained to understand the
correlation between the features/predictor of the dataset and
the target variable(suicides_no). We will be predicting the
suicide number/count given a specific year, pertaining to a
certain age group and gender.
The Final part of my project involves comparison of the
performance of each model. Each model would be compared
based on accuracy to see which one performed best. The
performance evaluation would be done using the R-squared
score.
